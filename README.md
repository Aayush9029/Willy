A program that will release your untold secerets X days after you ðŸ’€ ~~or forget to check-in~~

> If they're unable unable to check-in for whatever reason this will make the stored secret public.. Perhaps by tweeting it? or posting to some forums or sending a message to someone?


My Rough Plan-ish.

- Self-hostable server or "public encrypted" server which will contain the data (encrypted data), *the key to unlock the data will be stored somewhere else secure*.
- Every X days or weeks if the user doesn't login (check-in) or if user checks-in in via (honeypot) like password it'll trigger the "Send Protocol"
- **Send Protocol:** Will use the stored key to decrypt the data and publish it where-ever the user wanted it to.
